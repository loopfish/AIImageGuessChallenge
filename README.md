# ImagineMate - Multiplayer Guessing Game

ImagineMate is a real-time multiplayer guessing game powered by Google's Generative AI that creates unique, dynamic image-based challenges. Players compete by deciphering AI-generated images and matching their original prompts in a fast-paced, collaborative environment.

## üéÆ How It Works

1. **Create a Game**: A host creates a new game and receives a unique game code to share with friends.
2. **Join the Lobby**: Players join using the game code and wait in the lobby until the host starts the game.
3. **Prompt Time**: The host enters a creative text prompt (e.g., "elephants wearing tutus and dancing to breakbeat").
4. **AI Magic**: Google's Gemini AI generates an image based on the prompt.
5. **Guess & Score**: Players view the image and submit their best guesses of what the original prompt was.
6. **Points & Ranking**: Players earn points based on accuracy and speed:
   - 3 points for the winner
   - 2 points for second place
   - 1 point for third place
7. **Multiple Rounds**: Games consist of multiple rounds, with scores tallied across all rounds.
